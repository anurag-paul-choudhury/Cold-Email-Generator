# Cold Email Generator

An AI-powered tool for service-based outreach using Groq, LangChain, and Streamlit.  
Users provide a company careers page URL, and the tool extracts job listings to generate personalized cold emails.  
Emails are enriched with relevant portfolio links retrieved from a vector database, tailored to each job description.
